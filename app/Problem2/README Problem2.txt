Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

A: Status: Completed
 Working Status: FullFunc
 ReadMe Status: Completed
 RunTime Status: Optimal

B: Problem
 Find the sum of all even Fibonacci Numbers under 4,000,000 

C: Logic Explanations
 Fibonacci Numbers: Each term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
    - Numbers 1 and 2 are used to begin 

 See Problem 1 for modulo (%) explanations    

 Test data
    Fibonacci Numbers 1-10: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

D: Main Logic Steps
 1. Instantiate Variables:
    1a. All Fibonacci Numbers (allFibNums)
    1b. Even Fibonacci Sum (evenFibSum)

 2. Add 1 and 2 to Fibonacci List - Sum begins at 2 to account for this

 3. For loop until max value of allFibNums > 4,000,000
    3a. Add new Fibonacci value to allFibNums
    3b. If new number is even add to evenFibSum

 4. Return evenFibSum
