## Problem 0: Example Problem 


**Problem Status:**
    
    This is where the status for each language in the project will be stored
    C#: Completed & Commented (This signifies that the code is fully accessible to look at)
    Java: Completed (This signifies that the code is completed, but might not be commented in a helpful way)
    Javascript: Incomplete (This signifies that while there might be code at the solution, the code does not yet reach the correct result)
    Python: Not Started (This signifies that the (mediocre) programmer on this project has not started this solution yet)

    Also provided here, will be the filePaths to the files that store the solution if the status is above completed


**Statement of Problem:**

    This area will be where the problem statement will be stored. 
    This text will not be my own, and will be copied directly from projecteuler.net
    This is just to help understand the scope of the project 


**Main Pseudo-Code:**

    This area will list in steps how I plan to complete this problem, regardless of which language I am completing it in
    Looking at this written code should help format your own code, before you have to look at the actual methods

    Example Code:

    1. This would be a step in the process
    2L. This step could signify a loop
        2.1. This would signify step one that would be performed inside this loop
        2.2? The question mark will signify that this line will be an "if" statement of some sort
    3. This could signify a more complex step or logical leap
        3A. This is a more broken down version of step 3
        3B. This is step 2 of step 3
        3C. **These stars mean that there is additional information provided later on
    4. This method might include a sub method, and will be marked using method A() 



**Sub-Method Pseudo-Code**

    A() -> Down here we can provide more detail about this sub-method
        1. Including the steps to break everything down


**Logic Explanations**

    **Down here I will try to add details about any logical leaps that cannot be fully explained in the code,
        or would take up more space than is necessary in the Pseudo-code section.
